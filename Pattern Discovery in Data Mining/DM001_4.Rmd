###Lecture 4.1: Pattern Evaluation: Limitation of the Support-Confidence Framework
> Support and Confidence alone may not fully describe the interestingness of the association rule.

Example: 

|Play basketball|Not play basketball|sum(row)
---|---|---|---
Eat cereal|400|350|750
Not eat cereal|200|50|250
sum(col)|600|400|1000

Association rule:

1. play basketball => eat-cereal [400/1000 = 0.4, 400/600 = 0.67]
2. play basketball^c^ => eat-cereal [350/1000 = 0.35, 50/400 = 0.88]

Implies a misleading association rule.
